Presentation of the CoCo Design Pattern @ ECOOP 2021

Code is in nat where `Nat1.java` is the naive OO solution, `Nat2.java` is the EP Trivially version, and `Nat3.java` is the CoCo solution.
Use `make Nat1.class`, `make Nat2.class`, and `make Nat3.class` from the `nat` directory to build things or see problems.
Only `Nat3.java` is supposed to compile and run.
